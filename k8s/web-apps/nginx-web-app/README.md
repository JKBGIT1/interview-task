# nginx-web-app

The app should have some basic security hardening thanks to:

- NetworkPolicy
- Enforcing `baseline` Pod Security Standards on its namespace
- Running it's pod as nonRoot user
- Having `securityContext` for its `nginx` container
- Read-only root FS, as a result, using the empty dir volumes
- Exposed over HTTPS using self-signed certificate generated by cert-manager

However, the supply chain of the application is still insecure. The nginx image isn't signed and verified before running in K8s. Same goes for the `deploy.yaml`. In order to achieve this goal, I'll have to leverage some external artifact registry. I believe that's out of the scope of this interview task. At least, that's what I want to think.

## Deployment to K8s

Once the FluxCD deploys ArgoCD, this application is under continuos deployment of ArgoCD following GitOps principle.
