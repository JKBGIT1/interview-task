# linkerd

The gatewayapi-crds.yaml was taken from https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.4.1/standard-install.yaml. They are required by Linkerd.

Linkerd also depends on `certificates.yaml`. The file contains Issuers and Certificates generated by cert-manager to support mTLS. In a real world scenario they might be taken from some Key Vault or at least uploaded to the Key Vault after the automatic generation. I decided not to host the Key Vault in this cluster cause it kinda doesn't make sense (at least to me) to have it in the same environment as the generated K8s Secrets.

The `deploy.yaml` deploys the `linkerd-crds`, `linkerd-control-plane`, and `linkerd-viz` Helm Charts using the FluxCD's HelmReleases.
