# linkerd

The gatewayapi-crds.yaml was taken from https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.4.1/standard-install.yaml

Linkerd also depends on `certificates.yaml`. The file contains Issuers and Certificates generated by cert-manager to support mTLS. In a real world scenario they might be provided from some Key Vault or at least uploaded to the Key Vault after the automatic generation. I decided not to host the Key Vault in this cluster cause it kinda doesn't make sense to me to have it in the same environment as the generated K8s Secrets.
